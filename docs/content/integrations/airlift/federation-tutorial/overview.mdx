# Airflow Federation Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates using `dagster-airlift` to observe DAGs from multiple Airflow instances, and federate execution between them using Dagster as a centralized control plane.

Using `dagster-airlift` we can

- Observe Airflow DAGs and their execution history
- Directly trigger Airflow DAGs from Dagster
- Set up federated execution _across_ Airflow instances

All of this can be done with no changes to Airflow code.
